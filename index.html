      <p>
        Welcome to Regex Geist, a place where you can learn about regular expressions.<br>So what is regular expressions? Regular expressions are a way to match patterns in text. They are used to validate and extract information from text. Regular expressions are used in many programming languages, including JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Java.

            <div class="card-body">
              <p>Regex anchors are special characters in regular expressions that allow you to match specific positions in a string. They do not match any actual characters, but rather represent positions before or after characters in a string. The two main types of regex anchors are the caret ^ and dollar $.<br><br>The caret anchor matches the beginning of a line or string. For example, the regex "/^S/" would match any line or string that starts with "S".<br>The dollar sign anchor matches the end of a line or string. For example, the regex "/y$/" would match any line or string that ends with "y".<br>Try it yourself! the statements below will equal true when logged to the console.</p>

let caret = 'Spooky';
console.log(/^S/.test(caret));

// Notice the position of the $.
const dollar = 'Spooky';
console.log(/y$/.test(dollar));</code></pre>

            <div class="card-body">
              <p>Regex quantifiers are used to specify the number of times a particular character or group of characters can occur in a pattern. They allow you to match a specific number of occurrences or a range of occurrences of a character or group of characters.<br><br>To demonstrate this we will do a small exercise. Let's say we have an array of strings that contain color codes in the form of hexadecimal values. We want to extract all the valid color codes from the array and store them in a new array. We can use the regular expression /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ to match only valid color codes.<br><br>In the code below using the regular expression /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ with the filter() method, we were able to extract only the valid color codes from the array. </p>

              <p>Grouping constructs are used in regular expressions to group together parts of a pattern so that they can be treated as a single unit. They allow you to apply quantifiers, alternations, and other operations to the group as a whole, rather than to individual characters or character classes.<br><br>To demonstrate let's say we have a string that contains a mixture of valid and invalid color codes in the form of hexadecimal values. We want to extract only the valid color codes and store them in a new array, along with a label indicating whether they are three-digit or six-digit codes. We can use the grouping construct () in the regular expression to capture the matched value and differentiate between the two types of color codes.<br><br>By using the grouping construct () in the regular expression and capturing the matched value, we were able to differentiate between the two types of color codes and store them in a useful format.</p>

                Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, are a type of construct used in regular expressions to match a set of characters.

              <p>
                The OR operator, denoted by the vertical bar (|) or the pipe symbol, is a logical operator used in regular expressions to match one of two or more alternative patterns. It allows you to create more complex regular expressions by matching multiple patterns with a single regular expression.<br><br>To demonstrate this in the code below we have a form that allows users to enter either three-digit or six-digit color codes in the form of hexadecimal values, with or without a preceding hash symbol. We want to match either format using a single regular expression. We can use the OR operator (|) to match either the pattern [a-f0-9]{6} or [a-f0-9]{3}.<br><br>By using the OR operator (|) to match either the pattern [a-f0-9]{6} or [a-f0-9]{3}, we were able to match either format of color codes using a single regular expression, making our regular expression more efficient and flexible.
